This project is a Customer Churn Prediction Web Application built using Machine Learning and Streamlit.
It predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on customer details such as demographics, subscription type, and usage behavior.

The application provides an interactive UI where users can input customer data and get real-time churn predictions.
